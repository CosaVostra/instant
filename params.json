Hashtags may be ineffective and lists are not frequently updated or easily accessible. Valuable content is out there - it’s just **hard to find**. \r\n\r\n### !nstant helps you identify experts and witnesses on the ground and share that information on a large scale.\r\n\r\n**To understand and play with !nstant, [test ouf live demo](http://www.createinstant.com) now !**\r\n\r\n## !nstant for Publishers\r\n\r\n!nstant allows newsroom reporters and editors to do what they do best: curate valuable content and relevant voices. On !nstant, timelines and temporary follow lists are easy to create and easy to find.\r\n\r\nAnyone can be a publisher on !nstant: Users display their expertise around breaking news moments. Publishers choose the most reliable voices, add their own posts, create timelines, contextualize information and share their points of view. All of this in a platform designed to work easily and quickly, and focused on the place where most users are consuming the news nowadays: on mobile. \r\n\r\n## !nstant for Users\r\n\r\nFind Twitter information that has been already selected and organised in a platform designed to isolate what’s important and look for valuable sources. !nstant offers quick and easy access to different curated lists around a story. Choose between specific !nstant timelines created by journalists, editors, experts and general users - without altering your regular followers. Unfollow the list after the news event - your Twitter follower list never changes.\r\n\r\nTo create an !nstant, sign in with your Twitter account at [createinstant.com](http://www.createinstant.com). To build your timeline, look for interesting accounts in the \"Who to follow\" column or through key words in the \"Tweets\" column. A third column serves as a final filter: making sure only relevant tweets will show up in your !nstant timeline. Your final !nstant timeline will be the sum of filtered tweets from recommended accounts and the messages specially selected by you.\r\n\r\nAs your !nstant is published, followed accounts will be notified that they have been selected as a recommended source for an event.\r\n\r\n## Who's behind !nstant?\r\n\r\n!nstant was created by experienced journalists and digital entrepreneurs living in France, Spain, Chile and United States. !nstant began when the team members were all fellows at the **Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard**.\r\n* Ludovic Blecher is director of the Digital Innovation Press Fund Google&AIPG - [@lblecher](http://twitter.com/lblecher)\r\n* Alexandra Garcia, Senior Video Journalist, The New York Times.

The recurrence could be hourly.\r\n\r\n## MySQL\r\n\r\n* Create the process and the trigger to receive, sort and feed the !nstants with the tweets arriving through the Twitter Streaming API. The code to launch on a regular basis is in `trigger.sql`\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n!nstant was developed by [CosaVostra](http://www.cosavostra.com) and [createInstant.com](http://www.createinstant.com) is hosted on [Pilot Systems](http://www.pilotsystems.net/).\r\n","google":"UA-49875688-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
