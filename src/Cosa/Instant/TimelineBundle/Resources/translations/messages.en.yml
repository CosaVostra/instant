  The !nstant Team
about.title01: About
about.text01: During a breaking news situation the volume of information on social media can be overwhelming for anyone. Hashtags may be ineffective and lists are not frequently updated or easily accessible. Valuable content is out there--it’s just hard to find. !nstant helps to identify experts and witnesses on the ground and to share that information on a large scale.
about.title02: !nstant for Publishers
about.text02: |
  !nstant allows newsroom reporters and editors to do what they do best: curate valuable content and relevant voices. On !nstant, timelines and temporary follow lists are easy to create and easy to find.

  Anyone can be a publisher on !nstant: Users display their expertise around breaking news moments. Publishers choose the most reliable voices, add their own posts, create timelines, contextualize information and share your points of view. All of this in a platform designed to work easily and quickly, and focused on the place where most users are consuming the news nowadays: on mobile. 
about.title03: !nstant for Users
about.text03: |
  Find Twitter information that has been already selected and organized in a platform designed to isolate what’s important and look for valuable sources. !nstant offers quick and easy access to different curated lists around a story. Choose between specific !nstant timelines created by journalists, editors, experts and general users--without altering your regular followers. Unfollow the list after the news event--your Twitter follower list never changes.

  To create an !nstant, sign in with your Twitter account at www.createinstant.com. To build your timeline, look for interesting accounts in the "Who to follow" column or through key words in the "Tweets" column. A third column serves as a final filter: making sure only relevant tweets will show up in your !nstant timeline. Your final !nstant timeline will be the sum of filtered tweets from recommended accounts and the messages specially selected by you.

  As your !nstant is published, followed accounts will be notified that they have been selected as a recommended source for an event.
